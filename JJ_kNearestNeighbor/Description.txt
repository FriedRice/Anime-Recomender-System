Input data
Create matrix matching show_name to index

1) Find people who have watched and rated the same shows, and more, than our input user.

Create matrix of show_names X user_names (rows X cols), where each element ij is 1 if user j watched show i, 0 otherwise
Calculate distance between input user and all other users (distance = sum over all shows I[input user has rated the show and comparison user has not)]
Grab x closest users and put them into a new matrix

2) Among these people, find the k users who give normalized ratings in a similar fashion to our input user.

Normalize ratings of each user (column).
Calculate distance between input user and all other users, normalized by number of shows compared (distance = sum of differences in ratings, divided by sqrt(sum of (differences squared)), for each show that both users watched).
Grab the k closest users to our input user.

3) Among the k best matching users, find the show most highly rated but not yet watched by input user.

Filter out all rows (shows) that the input user has already watched (not necessarily the same as already rated).
For each show, if it has been watched by at least n of our remaining k users, take the average of all k user ratings.
Grab the highest average show rating and return.
